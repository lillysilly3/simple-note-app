## Getting Started

**Requirements:** Ruby 2.7+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lillysilly3/simple_note_app
cd simple_note_app
ruby main.rb
```

## Project Structure

- `main.rb` - Entry point
- `application.rb` - Main application loop
- `menu.rb` - User interaction and menu actions
- `manager.rb` - Business logic layer
- `database.rb` - PStore persistence layer
- `note.rb` - Note model

## What I Learned

- Object-oriented Ruby design with classes and modules
- Separating concerns across model, database, and application layers
- Persisting data with Ruby's built-in PStore
- Input validation and error handling
